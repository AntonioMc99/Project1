This project is a simple IP Address Tracker I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users type in an IP address or domain and shows where it’s located using the IPify API. It gives you info like the city, region, timezone, and the internet provider. When the page first loads, it automatically shows your own IP location too, which is pretty cool. I used LeafletJS to show the location on a map, and that part took some figuring out since I’d never used a map library before. I also learned how to work with API data and update the page without reloading. Styling it to look decent on phones and desktops helped me practice responsive design. This whole project pushed me out of my comfort zone in a good way and made me feel more confident working with JavaScript and APIs.
